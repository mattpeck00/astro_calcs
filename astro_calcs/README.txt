This is a simple BASH Script that pulls API from 
the following website:http://astro.met.no/astro/


See Documentation at https://github.com/FrankThomasTveter/astro-api/wiki .


This was my first time learning BASH and I wanted to post it for 
others to learn from and grow on. 

I recommend installing CURL with this line of code:

>sudo apt install curl

For more info about using CURL for this project go check out this web page:

Also I utilized VIM in order to edit the existing code within the Shell.
